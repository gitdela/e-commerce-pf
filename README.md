## eCommerce Website

This project is an eCommerce website I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides users with a platform to browse and purchase products online.

This project was mainly built so I can get conversant with building full blown website with mainly the 3 essentials in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

On the Shop page, when you click the first product, it should open a detailed product page. This functionality has not been added to the other products on the Shop page yet. You can access it online via https://gitdela.github.io/e-commerce-pf/

# Features

- Product Catalog: The website offers a wide range of products organized into different categories. Users can browse through the catalog and view detailed information about each product.

- Responsive Design: The website is built with a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.

# Technologies Used

- HTML: The structure and content of the website's pages.
- CSS: The styles and layout of the website's elements.
- JavaScript: The interactivity and functionality of the website.

# Installation

To run the eCommerce website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the website.

# Usage

Once the website is up and running, users can perform the following actions:

- Browse products by category and view detailed product information.
- Under the shop page, you can click the first product to get more details. That functionality has not been built into the rest of the products yet.
